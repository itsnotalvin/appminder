# Appminder

Appminder is a digital resource that helps you organise the details of your job applications throughout the recruitment process. You can sort your applications throughout the 4 stages of 'Drafting', 'Applied', 'Interviewing', 'Awaiting'.

You can use Appminder at `https://appminder.herokuapp.com/`


## Approach Taken
- We approached this application to provide a solution to everyone who is in the job application process. We understand the pain points of applying to multiple jobs and losing track of the numerous jobs you apply for. Thus we developed this project to help others track their applications throughout the job processes through an easy and intuitive 'drag and drop' function.
